## Scythe fans
My uptime was only 20days this time, but my hard drives continually throw (very hot) tempature warnings, so i found some budget sythe fans to add to the rig.

May need a little thumb screw driver to get at the very tiny/hard to reach areas. the quickly evolved into a very inolved project requiring the removal of the motherboard to remove the HDD fan, along with some needle nose pliers because some poor standoff wasn't ready for this.
Is there a tool for securing motherboard standoffs?
While I'm here the case has a notiable amount of dust and using a clorax wipe does not help clean up, using a microfibre cloth does a much better job of picking up dust around the case.
All said and done a 120m fits very snug in place of the 40m fan without anything holding it in place it appears stable.
While I'm in here I notice my DIMMS are populating A2 and B1 so just going to move that 1 stick to the right place.
