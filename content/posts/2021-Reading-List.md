Things I read in 2021 sorted into a few catagories. Technical Books for things about programming and systems architecture, Novels for most of the Sci-fi and fiction i read. and Finally the Manga and Light novels I read to relax.

## Technical Books

### C programming
Possibly one of the most refrenced books in programming.

### Pragmatic Programmer
Highly recommend reflecting on the contents here. Principles such a DRY are timeless. Less about how to and more about thinking like a high functioning developer.

### Mythical Man-Month

### This is how they tell me the world ends

### System design interview
